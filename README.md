# VBA-challenge

I worked with a TA on this code. I initally wrote 

'opendt = WorksheetFunction.Min(Range("B:B"))
    'Debug.Print opendt
    'closeddt = WorksheetFunction.Max(Range("B:B"))
    'Debug.Print closeddt
    
 and the TA helped with the i loop in my code due to my confusion on what the assignment was asking.
